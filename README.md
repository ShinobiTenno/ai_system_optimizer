# AI System Optimizer

![AI System Optimizer](app_icon.ico)

A powerful Windows tool designed to analyze and optimize system performance for AI applications.

## About the Developer

This software is developed by Shinobi_Tenno (Laurens S.), who lives with COPD Alpha-1 (currently at 34% lung capacity). Through this project, we aim not only to provide useful software but also to raise awareness about COPD and Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.

## About Alpha-1 COPD

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (Alpha-1) is a genetic form of COPD that affects both the lungs and liver. Unlike typical COPD, Alpha-1 can affect people regardless of smoking history or age. Early detection and treatment are crucial for managing this condition.
